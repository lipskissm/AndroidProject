Diet Optimizer - Android project

This was my and my teams semesters work of Software engineering course. App features a questionare and goals databases that collects data that helps the function to calculate how much calories you need to consume
to reach your diatary goals. App also has a feature to suggest you meals based on your diatary goals. For example if your goal is to gain muscle the algorythm will suggest to you meals that have a higher protein count

This project is not yet finished. The algorythm needs adjustments, some of the code is redundant, CI/CD is lacking and meals are hard coded. The following changes from now on are made just by me.
